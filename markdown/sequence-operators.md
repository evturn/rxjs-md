## Sequence Operators

RxJS follows JavaScript conventions where the syntax for the operators are the same for array operators.

### `map`

`map` is the most used transformation operator.

Takes an Observable and a function. It applies that function to each of the values in the source Observable and returns a new Observable with the transformed values.
